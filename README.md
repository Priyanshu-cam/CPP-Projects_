# C++ Small Projects

This repository contains a collection of small **C++ mini projects** created to
strengthen core programming fundamentals and object-oriented concepts.

Each project is built step by step while learning C++, focusing on **clarity,
logic, and clean structure** rather than shortcuts.

## 🧑‍🏫 Why this README is better (important learning)

### 1️⃣ Clear purpose
It explains **why** this repo exists — learning & fundamentals.

### 2️⃣ Projects are explained, not just listed
Anyone reading understands:
- What the project does
- What concepts you practiced

### 3️⃣ Concepts section = BIG PLUS
Interviewers love this because it shows:
> “He knows *why* he built it, not just *what* he built.”

### 4️⃣ Run instructions
Makes your project usable by others.

### 5️⃣ Future plans
Shows growth mindset 🚀

## 🔥 Pro Tip (Very Important)

As you add more projects, just extend:

```md
### 2️⃣ Hospital Management System
### 3️⃣ ATM Simulation
### 4️⃣ Undo / Redo System
Each with:

Features

Concepts practiced

This turns your repo into a portfolio, not just storage.
