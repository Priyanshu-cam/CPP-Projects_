# Calculator Application in C++

## 📘 Description
This project is a **menu-driven calculator application built using C++**.  
It performs basic as well as some advanced mathematical operations and **stores a history of all calculations** performed during runtime.

The project is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and includes **proper input validation and exception handling** to make it robust and user-friendly.

## ✨ Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with division-by-zero protection)
- Modulo operation
- Power calculation
- Square root calculation
- Calculation history tracking
- Continuous execution until user exits

---

## 🧑‍💻 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Encapsulation)
- STL (`vector`)
- Exception Handling (`try-catch`)
- Input Validation
- Formatted Output (`iomanip`)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** GCC (or any standard C++ compiler)

## 📂 File Structure
 C++ // main folder 
 Calculator // code file 
 README.md // read me file 


 ## Working Explanation
- The program displays a menu and takes user input.
- Based on the selected option, the corresponding function of the Calculator class is executed.
- Every calculation is saved in a history vector.
- Users can view all previous calculations in a neatly formatted table.
- The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
